## Prerequisits:

- DL/ML and related python libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scipy, sklearn, or some more)
- Basic understanding of BCI and EEG devices
- PCB design using Autodesk Eagle
- understanding of Arduino 
- ROS basics (optional)
- a general idea of time-domain and frequency-domain circuits. 
- classification algorithms (like CNN, SVM, k-clustering, and so on).
- shell script (UNIX commands)

----------------------------------------------------------------


## Guidlines: 
**Firstly, the project is divided into 3 parts:** 
  1) EEG circuit building
  2) Brain Signal analysis
  3) robotics and controls subsystem  

***You choose any of the parts and start working on it according to the instructions and resources provided.***
