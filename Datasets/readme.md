**Description:** This contains Motor Imagery data of the left and right hand of a subject.
Each of the npy files is of the shape `(99,64,3584)`. These are 99 trials, each consisting of 64 channels of eeg data recorded at sampling rate of 512 Hz.

This is only a part of the original published data, where a total of 52 subjects were studied. Various mental tasks were recorded in EEG (Motor Imagery data is only one of the tasks). The complete dataset can be found [here](http://gigadb.org/dataset/view/id/100295). **An in-depth description of the data is provided in the [accompanying article](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/6/7/gix034/3796323).**
